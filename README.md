## Overview

The goal of this project is to practice setting up the gem Devise in a rails app in different ways to explore it's uses.
I will losely follow some youtube tutorials - for which I'll list links here - in addition to familiarizing myself with the **[Devise documentation](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)**.

### Basic set up

1. Rails app using postgresql and no minitest.
2. Add rspec and figaro.
3. In addition, I installed other gems primarily with the purpose of practicing writing tests as well. These include should-matchers, capybara, pry.
4. Simplecov and rubocop were added for feedback.
